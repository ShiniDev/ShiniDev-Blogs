    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>
        I'm Mark Joefrey Jan Willard M. Laurente, currently taking <strong>BS in
            Computer Science</strong>. I'm currently <strong>learning</strong> on
        different aspects of computer science. Specifically, some low level languages,
        graphic apis, web development and looking forward to more interesting topics such
        as network programming, machine learning and multithreading.

    <h2 id="java">Experiences with Java</h2>
    <p>
        <em>Java</em> is the first language that I have actually learned, because it
        is the language that was taught on our ICT class when I was on grade 12. The
        class introduced the basics of programming, and by the end of the
        2<sub>nd</sub> semester, we were able to create simple GUI through abstract
        windows toolkit of Java. During this class I was not serious at programming
        at all, as I was not self studying or anything, but despite that I was still
        able to come out top in the class. Summer break came and I was going to be a
        college student, it was around march and april, I was self studying in Java
        but only for like a short time like only 1 to 2 hours only, during that time
        I was able to remake the calculator that We have made on our class, from a
        AWT to something else. After that I was lazy again and I didn't study until
        August 2020. I was already enrolled in College and I figured I needed to be
        better than the rest of the class and it is also for my self, so I began
        self-studying again in java, from the website called
        <a href="https://mooc.fi">Mooc</a> at first, I only spend like 30 minutes
        to 1 hour until programming became my passion and the next thing I knew
        I was studying it for the whole day. During my time in Mooc
        (August-September), I was able to strengthen and improve my foundation
        in programming, I have better understanding on
        conditions,loops,containers,objects,classes and mindset. Now my
        1<sub>st</sub> semester ended in college and I got 1.00 in our <em>Java
            Programming I</em> subject.

    <h2 id="c++">Experiences with C++</h2>
    <p>
        I started learning C++, November 27, 2020. Specifically, because at the
        time, I was doing some simple games in Godot game engine. There was a
        situation that the game weren't fps friendly, that's when I remember
        about languages that are fast and the one language that were fast and
        yet can be used in game development was C++, this is where my journey
        with C++ began. I picked up the book <em>Programming Principles and
            Practices using C++</em> by Bjarne Stroustrup, as my first learning
        material in C++, currently on writing this I'm on page 600. During my
        journey with c++ and the book. I created projects, that I was proud of,
        like recently, I finished my Command line interface Banking System which
        can save/load data, has an admin/user interface, and of course
        withdrawal/deposit function, problem is that it only runs on windows,
        and currently on writing this page now, I recently switched from Windows
        to Ubuntu just this past two days.

    <h2 id="php">Experiences with PHP</h2>
    <p>
        I started learning php on April 13, 2021. Because me and my friend applied
        as an OJT for a local information technology company and the backend
        language that they were using is php. It is the first interpreted language
        that I have learned. I didn't know a language could be so flexible yet so
        fast. Since we have been an OJT on zerobstacle, I have been learning a lot
        and quite overwhelmed on the first weeks. It's been a blast since then and
        gave me a new perspective on how broad computer science can be. I have been
        learning PHP since then. I did simple projects, like a pure php coupon
        generator and a codeigniter php coupon generator. But now hehehe, my very
        first big project since learning programming. A blog site with content
        management system. During building this project, I am very proud that I
        learned a lot. I will continue to learn whatever is left to learn and I'm
        pretty sure I won't get tired of it.
